# MonkeGame2D

(NEW UPDATE)

Today, I launched the final update before the game goes out of Beta and into release!

Some new features:
- A mobile friendly keyboard (what might that lead to in the future ðŸ˜‰)
- Fixed Movement (you can climb trees better)
- Banning ðŸ”¨


Introuduction:

Welcome to MonkeGame2D, as some of you might know, this game is inspired by Gorilla Tag. 
Run, jump, and climb as a monke with the arrow keys cuz humanity has failed us all.

You can invite your friends to join and a tag game will start. The IT will appear as a lava monke and must touch other monkes to tag them.

Hope you enjoy this game!
